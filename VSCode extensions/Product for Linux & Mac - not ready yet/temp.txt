Terminal Method
Open your terminal.
Navigate to the directory where your script is located using the cd command.
Run the following command to make your script executable:

chmod +x script-name.sh

GUI Method
Navigate to the folder containing your script using your file manager.
Right-click on the script file.
Select "Properties" or a similar option from the context menu.
Look for a "Permissions" tab or section.
Check the option that says “Allow executing file as program” or “Make file executable”.



Step 2: Run the Script from GUI
After making the script executable, you can run it directly from the file manager:

Double-click the script file. Depending on your desktop environment, this might run the script directly, or it might prompt you with a dialog asking if you want to Run or Display the script.
Choose “Run in Terminal” or simply “Run” depending on what options are available. This will execute the script in a terminal window, allowing you to see any output or provide input if necessary.
